# Instructions for Gabriel 

Before the day make sure you have the following files

- lookup.csv 
- post_round1.qmd
- post_round2.qmd
- post_tech.qmd

I've also created dummy results files that you can use to check you can generate the HTML. These are 

- round1.csv
- round2.csv
- tech.csv

On the day, these will be downloaded from the shiny app and need to be renamed.

You can download the non-tech scenario from [connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/elicitation_productivity](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/elicitation_productivity/test/)and the tech scenario from [connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/elicitation_productivity_tech](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/elicitation_productivity_tech/).
